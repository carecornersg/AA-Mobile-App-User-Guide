## Cancellation by IO/Call Centre

When IO or Call Centre Staff cancels your assigned case, you will receive a **Cancellation Notification**.

### When Does This Happen?

Case cancellation can occur when:

- The youth's situation has changed
- The interview is postponed or rescheduled
- Other operational reasons

### Step 1: Receive Cancellation Notification

When your assigned case is cancelled:

- You receive a push notification on your phone
- The notification includes cancellation details
- Tap to open the app

### Step 2: Acknowledge

Tap **Acknowledge** to confirm you have received and understood the cancellation notice.

After acknowledging, select **Advanced Cancellation** to submit documentation if the interview was cancelled before your arrival.

⏰ **Important:** You must acknowledge within **30 minutes**.

## What Happens After Acknowledging?

- The system logs your **acknowledgement timestamp**.
- You are released from the case (including **cooldown removal**) and can receive new case broadcasts.
- If the case was cancelled within **60 minutes** before the scheduled interview time and you were assigned, you may submit documentation within **24 hours** for payment purposes (see the **Onsite Cancellation** section below).

## What If You Don't Acknowledge?

If you don't acknowledge within **30 minutes**:

- The system **auto-acknowledges** the cancellation and the case proceeds to **Cancelled** status
- The system logs it as **auto-acknowledged** in the audit trail
- The cancelling user (Call Centre Staff/AAYS Manager) is notified that you did not acknowledge within 30 minutes

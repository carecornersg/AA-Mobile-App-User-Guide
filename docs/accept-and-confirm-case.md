## Low Priority Flag

⚠️ **Warning about declining at confirmation stage:**

If you decline or timeout without response after being selected:

- You receive a **Low Priority flag for 14 days**
- Lower chance of being selected in weighted selection (B1)
- This ensures commitment to accepted cases

📌 **Note:** Withdrawing during B1 holding period does **NOT** result in Low Priority flag.
